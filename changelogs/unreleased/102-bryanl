Reduce memory usage and allocations for object visitor 

* creates an allow list to reduce the number of objects that need to be checked when building the resource viewer
* changes the store API List function to return an unstructured list.
* bumps rest client's QPS
* stop using the cached resource viewer. the process should be quick enough to not have to rely on a cached version
* prefer unstructured objects in more places. this removes a few unnecessary conversions
